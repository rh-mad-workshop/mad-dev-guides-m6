== 1.1 What is Red Hat OpenShift AI?

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-ai[Red Hat OpenShift AI^] is a flexible, scalable MLOps platform with tools to build, deploy, and manage AI-enabled applications. Built using open source technologies, it provides trusted, operationally consistent capabilities for teams to experiment, serve models, and deliver innovative apps. OpenShift AI (previously called Red Hat OpenShift Data Science) supports the full lifecycle of AI/ML experiments and models, on-premise and in the public cloud.

In this workshop we will see how to use OpenShift AI to train a model, how to serve this model as an API, and how to create an intelligent application that will use this model. In exploring this content, you will become familiar with the OpenShift AI offering and the common workflows to use with it.

== 1.2. Access OpenShift AI

OpenShift AI has already been deployed in the workshop environment.

To get started, access https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.%SUBDOMAIN%[OpenShift AI web console^]

* Use the following credentials if you haven't logged in to the OpenShift cluster before. OpenShift is already integrated with https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on/[Red Hat Single Sign On^].

== 1.3. Quick tour of OpenShift AI

We will start this workshop with a quick overview of the different elements of OpenShift AI.

* In the **Applications->Enabled** section, you will have access or get information about all the applications that are available in this deployment of OpenShift AI:

* **Applications->Explore** will show you what other applications can be optionally added to OpenShift AI:

* **Data Science Projects** is where you can create projects and deploy different development environments (Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code, RStudio,...), add data connections, or serve models. We will use a data science project later in this workshop:

* **Model Serving** gives another view and access to all the models you are currently serving across different projects.

* And finally, **Resources** showcases various tutorials or demos helping your onboarding to the platform:

Now that we know our way around the OpenShift AI environment, let's do some data science!
