== 1.1 What is Red Hat OpenShift Data Science (RHODS)?

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-data-science[Red Hat OpenShift Data Science^] is a platform for data scientists, data engineers and developers of intelligent applications, running on OpenShift. It provides a fully supported environment in which to rapidly develop, train, and test machine learning (ML) models that can be deployed in production. You can of course also use it for more standard data analysis or data processing.

In this workshop we will see how to use OpenShift Data Science to train a model, how to serve this model as an API, and how to create an intelligent application that will use this model. In exploring this content, you will become familiar with the OpenShift Data Science offering and the common workflows to use with it.

== 1.2. Access OpenShift Data Science

OpenShift Data Science has already been deployed in the workshop environment.

To get started, access https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.%SUBDOMAIN%[RHODS web console^]

* Use the following credentials if you haven't logged in to the OpenShift cluster before. OpenShift is already integrated with https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on/[Red Hat Single Sign On^].

*  Login using your credentials:

** Username: `%USERID%`
** Password: `{openshift-password}`
 
Authorize the requested permissions if needed:

== 1.3. Quick tour of RHODS

We will start this workshop with a quick overview of the different elements of RHODS.

* In the **Applications->Enabled** section, you will have access or get information about all the applications that are available in this deployment of RHODS:

* **Applications->Explore** will show you what other applications can be optionally added to RHODS:

* **Data Science Projects** is where you can create projects and deploy different development environments (Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code, RStudio,...), add data connections, or serve models. We will use a data science project later in this workshop:

* **Model Serving** gives another view and access to all the models you are currently serving across different projects.

* And finally, **Resources** showcases various tutorials or demos helping your onboarding to the platform:

Now that we know our way around the RHODS environment, let's do some data science!
