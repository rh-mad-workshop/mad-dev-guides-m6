= 5. Building and deploying an intelligent application - 10 minutes
:imagesdir: ../assets/images

The application we are going to deploy is a simple example of how you can add an *intelligent* feature powered by AI/ML to an application. It is a webapp that you can use on your phone to discover coupons on various items you can see in a store, in an augmented reality way.

== 5.1. Architecture

participant f as Frontend
participant b as Backend
participant p as Pre-Post Processing Service
participant m as Model Server

f ->> b : Send the image<br/>to analyze
b ->> p : Pass the image to<br/>the pre-post processing service
p ->> m : Pre-process the image<br/>and call the model server
m ->> p : Send back the inference result
p ->> b : Post-process the inference<br/>and send back the result
b ->> f : Pass the result to<br/>the frontend for display
....

The different components are:

* The Frontend: a https://react.dev/[React^] application, typically running on the browser of your phone,
* The Backend: a NodeJS server, serving the application and relaying API calls,
* The Pre-Post Processing Service: a Python https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/[FastAPI^] service, doing the image pre-processing, calling the model server API, and doing the post-processing before sending the results back.
* The Model Server: the OpenShift AI component serving the model as an API to do the inference.

NOTE: This architecture could be simplified by "merging" the Backend part and the Pre-Post Processing service. In this workshop we kept the two separated so that you can verify by yourself that the code running in the Pre-Post Processing service is the same as the one we used in the notebook in the previous section.

== 5.2. Deploy the application

The deployment of the application is really easy, as we already created for you the necessary YAML files. They are included in the Git project we used for this workshop. You can find them **in the `deployment` folder inside you Jupyter environment**, or directly https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/mad_m6_workshop/tree/main/deployment[here^]. 

Of course, you can take a few minutes to look at the code of the Frontend, Backend or the Pre-Post Processing service.

To deploy the Pre-Post Processing Service service and the Application:

- From your https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%/k8s/cluster/projects/%USERID%-data-science-project[OpenShift Console^], navigate to your project, **%USERID%-data-science-project**, and select the "Import YAML" button, the "plus" sign on the top right:

- Copy/Paste the content of the file `pre_post_processor_deployment.yaml` inside the Window. If you have named your model `coolstore` as instructed, you're good to go. If not, modify the value on line 35 with the name you set. You can then select `Create`:

- Copy/Paste the content of the file `intelligent_application_deployment.yaml` inside the Window. Nothing to change here, you can then select `Create`:

image::create_application_deployment.png[]

- Go back to https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%/k8s/cluster/projects/%USERID%-data-science-project?view=graph[OpenShift web console^] if both deployments are successful.

== 5.3. Use the application

The application is relatively straightforward to use. Click on the URL for the Route `ia-frontend` that was created. This URL should be: https://ia-frontend-%USERID%-data-science-project.%SUBDOMAIN%/[https://ia-frontend-%USERID%-data-science-project.%SUBDOMAIN%/^]

You have first to allow it to use your camera, this is the interface you get:

image::app_ui.png[]

You have:

- The current view of your camera.
- A button to take a picture:

image::take_picture_button.png[]

- A button to switch from front to rear camera if you are using a phone:

image::switch_camera_button.png[]

- A QR code that you can use to quickly open the application **on a phone** (much easier than typing the URL!):

image::qr_code_example.png[]

When you take a picture, it will be sent to the inference service, and you will see which items have been detected, and if there is a promotion available!

== 5.4. Tweak the application

There are two parameters you can change on this application:

- On the `ia-frontend` Deployment, you can modify the `DISPLAY_BOX` environment variable from `true` to `false`. It will hide the bounding box and the inference score, so that you get only the coupon *flying* over the item.
- On the `ia-inference` Deployment, the one used for pre-post processing, you can modify the `COUPON_VALUE` environment variable. The format is simply an Array with the value of the coupon for the 3 classes: bottle, hat, shirt. As you see, these values could be adjusted in real time, and this could even be based on another ML model! But this would be a subject for another workshop.
